# **Interactive Bivariate Map of US National Parks**


There are 63 national parks according to the National Park Foundation. Each one displays a spectacular sense of beauty which demands complete preservation to ensure the health of native species and to spark appreciation for America's natural treasures. National parks are facing a popularity crisis with technology, successful marketing, and tourism bringing millions of visitors to national parks each year. National parks were once a place to disconnect from the modern world, but they have rapidly transformed into millennial amusement parks doomed to leave a trace


I designed an interactive map of national park locations in the United States. The map incorporated multiple variables that came together to form an aesthetically pleasing and comprehensible choropleth map.


This map serves as a reminder to respect the wildnerness and wildlife abundant within national parks. With increased awareness and sensitivity toward nature comes the desire to preserve and protect.
